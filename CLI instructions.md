# askphotos.earth Ground-Truth Data Generator (CLI)

## 🛠 Step 1: Install Python
Before running the script, you must have Python installed.
1. Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

---

## 📥 Step 2: Save the Script to Your Machine
You need the processing script and a list of links to begin.

1. **Create a Folder:** Create a new folder on your computer named e.g. `AskPhotos`.
2. **Save the Script:** Save the inside that folder the `generate_map_cli.py` file. 
https://github.com/askphotos-earth/Ground-Truth-Data-Generator/blob/main/generate_map_cli.py
3. **Prepare Your Links:** Create a csv or txt file in the same folder named `links.csv` or `links.txt`. The script will exclude any text inside the file except these URLs. For instance, you can upload a form responses in CSV format or a exported WhatsApp group chat in TXT format, and the GTD Generator will find the Google Photos URLs only.

## 📦 Step 3: Install Required Libraries
Open your terminal and run the following command to install the necessary tools:

1. Pillow: Handles image opening and quality compression.
2. requests: Downloads the images and album data from Google's servers.
3. exifread: Reads the hidden GPS and timestamp data inside your photos.
4. google-genai (Optional): Connects to Google's Gemini AI to generate semantic descriptions.

```bash
pip install Pillow requests exifread pillow-heif google-genai
```

## 🚀 Step 4: Run the Generator
In your terminal, navigate to your AskPhotos folder and run one of the following commands (change python3 version if different):

**Basic**

This scans your links in the CSV or TXT file (change to .txt below if your file is in TXT format), extracts image data and metadata from the album webpages shared with you, and creates a geojson file, without downloading photos or using AI to generated short descriptions.

```bash
python3 generate_map_cli.py --file links.csv
```
**Basic + Download + AI-generated descriptions**

This compresses/saves images locally and uses AI to create a short description of each photo and include it in the geojson as an attribute. 

-*Option 1 - Google Gemini:* Create a key at https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys. 

```bash
python3 generate_map_cli.py --file links.csv --download --quality 70 --key YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_KEY
```
-*Option 2 - Lightweight, open-source AI models*: (under development)🚧

**Basic + Download + AI-generated descriptions + Confidence** (under development)🚧

This will generate a confidence level based on your prompt/ground-truth data needs.

📝 Command Options

1. download:	Include this flag if you want to save local compressed copies of the photos. ❗ Keep in mind the local storage available when activating this option.
2. quality:	Set the image compression quality from 1-100 (70 is recommended). 
3. key:	Your Google Gemini API Key. Get one for free at AI Studio. ❗ Keep in mind the costs when activating this option.

## 🗺 Step 5: View and analyse the ground-truth data
Once the process is complete, a photos.geojson file will appear in your folder. Drag & drop the file in [askphotos.earth Map Viewer](https://askphotos.earth/pages/viewer) to visualise the map data, or analyse it using QGIS/ArcGIS or AI-powered geospatial analysis tools.
